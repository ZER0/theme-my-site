Theme My Site
=============

A work week prototype made to creates add-on from devtools. It's a proof of
concept, strongly in WIP, full of bugs. :)

It basically records the CSS changes made by the Rules and Style editor in
devtools, and generate a XPI from them, so that they can be easily be shared
across users, or published on AMO.

The audience's target of this type of add-on are designers more than pure
developers.
